# Interictal Spike Detector

This is the Python implementation of Dr. Erin Conrad's interictal spike detector. Interictal spikes are important in epileptogenesis. Detection of these spikes, however, is a non-trivial engineering problem.

## Features

- **Fast**: This implementation takes advantage of concurrency and runs up to 10 times faster than existing implementation.
- **Validated**: Dr. Conrad's spike detector was validated by board-certified epileptologists and used for publications. This implementation was validated against Dr. Conrad's results and achieved over 95% accuracy. See [here]() for more validation results.
